Calorie Counter App

This application was created using components from the cava menu and roll the dice application used in the lectures.
The calorie counter allows the user to calculate their intake of calories.

The foods are divided into five categories such as Fruit & Veg, Meat,Bread,Drinks and Snacks.

Each of the categories have a list of foods which have an image and a calorie amount for the food in question.

The calorie app uses a sidemenu template and the foods are contained in the dishes.html file.

Click on the food and the calories for that food is kept in the total daily intake, each time a food is clicked, they are added to the total and the amount of 
calories consumed that day is displayed in the total daily intake section. Press reset to go back to zero.

If the first time you click on a food it doesn't work, go back to the recommended daily intake and press reset, then press on food again, it works.

All the images were obtained from public sources.

The project is available on github : https://github.com/christinemb/ionic-assignment.
